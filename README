picsnvideos is a plugin for JPilot, which fetches pictures and
videos from late model Palm smartphones.

It has only been tested on the Centro.  It will probably also work on
the Treo 680, Treo 700p, and Treo 755p.  Picsnvideos requires that the jpegs
and videos are stored in a /DCIM hierarchy on either internal memory or
an expansion card.

This is very early alpha code.  Be warned!

The picsnvideos plugin fetches, rather than syncs.  It keeps a history 
of previously fetched pictures and videos in the .jpilot directory, 
so only new pictures and videos are fetched.  It never deletes files or 
writes to the Palm.  Once a file is fetched, it is never fetched again 
even if it is moved to a different album.

Files are fetched from the internal memory to $HOME/PilotPictures/Device,
and from the SD Card to $HOME/PalmPictures/SDCard.  Each album
is stored in its own subdirectory.  Since the fetch history is stored
elsewhere, you can delete files from the PilotPictures hierarchy without
affecting the picsnvideos plugin.

I haven't yet set up the 'configure' script, so you'll have to hack 
with the Makefile to compile picsnvideos.  Requirements are pilot-link
and gdbm.  GTK is not required; I've included a hacked libplugin.h
that comments out all the GTK stuff.
